# Sefirot

This app models and visualizes the seven lower sefirot ("numbers", translated literally) of Jewish metaphysics.

The sefirot are very esoteric. Esoteric need to mean "unsystematic", as it often does in modern parlance. The sefirot, and the broader Kabbalistic system they are components of, have received as rigorous a treatment as any formal discipline. Notably, Leibniz, the famous mathematician and philosopher, was influenced by Kabbalah, and his mathematical and metaphysical [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#Monads) can be traced back to the Kabbalistic system of Rabbi Isaac Luria. Each sefirot can be understood as one of Leibniz's metaphysical monads.

Metaphysical forces are principles, not postulates, and as such we should expect to find laws of nature that correspond to their demands. Modern physics has provided beautiful examples of such symmetry, so I have chosen English translations of the sefirot that evoke patterns evident in physics. The sefirot (like monads), are fractal structures, however, so correspondence should exist at every level of analysis -- mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, psychological and social. Plumbing the phenomenological world for these links is a very fun task! If you  think of a connection, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Visualizations

### 1. Chesed: *(e.g. Cosmic Inflation)*
`Existence expressing itself within existence`

![chesed](./animations/1-chesed-chesed.gif)

### 2. Gevurah: *(e.g. Dimension)*
`The provision of boundaries in the expression of existence to create independence (in space, time, etc)`

![gevurah](./animations/2-gevurah-chesed.gif)

### 3. Tiferet: *(e.g. Fractal Structure)*
`The perceivable connection between an existence and its expression`

![tiferet](./animations/3-tiferet-chesed.gif)

### 4. Netzach: *(e.g. Quantum Wave Functions)*
`The assertion of value in the expression of existence through stochasticity`

![netzach](./animations/4-netzach-chesed.gif)

### 5. Hod: *(e.g. Energy)*
`The recognition of existence in its expression actualizing some potentiality`

![hod](./animations/5-hod-chesed.gif)

### 6. Yesod: *(e.g. Nuclear Fusion)*
`The provision of a channel between an existence and external reality such that sharing becomes the foundation through which existence expresses itself`

![yesod](./animations/6-yesod-chesed.gif)

### 7. Malchut: *(e.g. Emergence)*
`The emergence of higher-order existence via the complex integration of a system’s elements only when that system interacts with a wider whole`

# Getting Started with the Sefirot Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it, just follow the directions below. **NOTE**: *I haven't yet added buttons to move between the sefirot, so the only way to see all seven is to edit the `currentSefira` variable in the `App.tsx` file. `1` corresponds to the *Chesed*, `2` corresponds to `Gevurah` and so on...*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
